# Meeting Tony Taylor
## History and Current Major
Tony was born and raised right here in Albany, Oregon in 1990. After working unfulfilling jobs for several years, Tony decided it was time to get an education in something substantial. So now Tony is attending Linn-Benton Community College majoring in Network and Systems Administration. Tony has no *current* plans in attending university once his time at LBCC is up.

Tony has found himself deep into dart-throwing as his main hobby. Regularly playing with friends, Tony did however find himself joining a dart league in Lebanon. Tony mentioned that there was a surprising amount of money to be made in professional dart scenes. Here are some of the top dart players and their earnings:
1. Michael van Gerwen - $2,106,609
2. Peter Wright - $1,238,333
3. Gerwyn Price - $999,385

Another hobby of Tony's is playing video games such as World of Warcraft, a game he's played off and on for nearly 15 years.
